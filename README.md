**DTM is a transport model of Arctic Driftwood.** 

Into the model, driftwood drifts with the sea ice as long as the sea ice is present (exprimed by a threshold). 

The model needs 4 inputs:

- Eastward sea ice velocity
- Northward sea ice velocity
- Eastward sea surface current
- Northward sea surface current
- Sea ice concentration
- Coordinates (longitudes and latitudes)
